## Lodging

We don’t plan on booking a hotel block - feel free to book accommodations that suit your needs! The wedding will be upcountry in Kula, which is lovely but farther from the beach where most of you will likely want to stay, especially if you’re visiting the island for the first time!

We will have [day-of shuttles](#day-of-shuttle) that will provide transportation from Kihei/Wailea (the south side of the island) to the wedding on 5/2 (more information to follow).

Here are some hotel recommendations!

### Wailea

More upscale, beautiful beaches.

* [The Fairmont Kea Lani](https://www.fairmont.com/en/hotels/hawaii-maui/fairmont-kea-lani.html) - great for groups of friends because all of their rooms are suites!
* [The Grand Wailea](https://www.grandwailea.com/) - a classic! Great pools.
* [The Residence Inn Maui Wailea](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/hnmri-residence-inn-maui-wailea/overview/) - we’ve heard it’s good for families because every room has a little kitchen!

### Kihei

More affordable (but still super nice), a bit more central, beautiful beaches.

* [Maui Coast Hotel](https://www.mauicoasthotel.com/)
* Renting condos in Kihei can be a great/slightly more affordable option as well, especially for groups.

### Kula

Where the Ratte house is located. It’s more rural, has gorgeous views, and cooler temperatures. Lodging is much more limited but there are a few places!

* [Kula Lodge](https://kulalodge.com/)
* [Kula Sandalwoods Cafe & Inn](https://kulasandalwoods.com/)

## Transportation
### Rental Cars

We recommend renting a car if you plan on exploring Maui beyond the immediate area of your accommodation.
* [Enterprise at Kahului Airport (OGG)](https://www.enterprise.com/en/car-rental-locations/us/hi/kahului-airport-36e4.html)
* [Turo on Maui (person-to-person car rentals)](https://turo.com/us/en/car-rental/united-states/kahului-hi)
